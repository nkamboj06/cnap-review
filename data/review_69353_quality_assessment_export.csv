The AT bracelet device (T-Line 400, Tensys Medical ®, San Diego, USA) was placed at the contralateral forearm to the arterial line (AL), connected to the monitor and set up as previously described [5]. The AL was then zeroed to the right atrium. A disposable sensor, which is attached to the bracelet, automatically detects and flattens the radial artery. A continuous maximum arterial pressure signal is derived by the sensor which is constantly floating on the artery. The acquired arterial signal is then processed with an underlying algorithm and scaled to display MAP, systolic arterial pres- sure (SAP) and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP).","
