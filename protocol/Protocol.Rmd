### Abstract

Continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) monitoring has been used substitute for the gold standard for arterial pressure assessment, which is invasive arterial pressure (IAP) measurement. The usefulness of CNAP monitoring in clinical practice is based on its <!--- I think we should probably just take out the sens/spec parts as I don't think there would have been many report on it sensitivity, specificity and---> limits of agreement both for detecting hemodynamic instability and changes in arterial pressure over time. The objective of this review is to summarise the evidence regarding the concordance between CNAP and invasive arterial pressure monitoring. Medline and EMBASE will be searched for studies published after the year 2000 using any clinically available CNAP monitors that reported on a measurement of the IAP that coincided with a measurement of CNAP. Study selection and quality assessment (using the QUADAS-2) will be performed independently by two reviewers. The GRADE approach will be used to summarize the strength of the body of evidence. If meta-analysis is deemed suitable, a pooled estimate of the limits of agreement between CNAP and IAP measurements from the included studies will be calculated. A synthesis of the existing evidence regarding the concordance between continous noninvasive and invasive arteria pressure measurements will assist clinicians by providing them with estimates about what should be expected from these devices in clinical practice. In addition, gaps in the evidence will be identified, which will need to be addressed in further research.

## Introduction

Arterial blood pressure monitoring is a mainstay of hemodynamic monitoring and is a requirement for patients in critical care settings, undergoing surgical interventions, during the postoperative period, and during interventions with distinct haemodynamic changes. For patients requiring continuous blood pressure monitoring, invasive arterial pressure monitoring is often used as the standard of care and involves arterial cannulation. The cannulation of an artery is painful, time-consuming, needs to be done by a trained clinician and there is risk of infection as well as tissue and nerve damage. In addition, specialised equipment is required in order to analyse arterial pressure continuously. For these reasons, BP is usually measured non-invasively intermittently or continuously. 

Intermittent BP monitoring involves an air-filled occluding cuff that enables BP to be measured either manually or automatically. While there are many benefits to intermittent BP monitoring, the devices are unable to provide real-time BP measurements and may leave BP fluctuations undetected or may lead to late recognition and delayed correction. For this reason, continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) monitoring is fast gaining importance due to complications associated with the IAP monitoring and addressing the limitations of intermittent BP monitoring. 

CNAP monitoring is based on two major principles: applanation tonometry and volume clamp. Both techniques enable the arterial waveform and BP values to be obtained continuously. Arterial applanation tonometry is based on the work of Pressman and Newgard, who discovered that a transducer strapped to an artery with a bone underneath, can obtain the arterial pulse wave. Since the initial observation, this technique has been refined and can now measure mean arterial pressure in the radial artery and allows the calculation of diastolic and systolic arterial pressure and other information from the pulse wave. Despite these attractive advantages, devices established using the applanation tonometry are not ideal for continuous monitoring as they have to be handheld by an examiner. Volume clamp is the other method of CNAP monitoring is based on the work by Penaz et al. (1976). BP is measured at the finger with an inflatable cuff combined with a photodiode. The diameter of the artery in the finger is measured by the photodiode and the pressure in the cuff is adjusted to keep the diameter of the artery constant. A BP curve can be calculated and transferred to correspond to brachial artery BP from the pressure changes in the cuff. Both these methods display real-time, continuous arterial pressure waveforms and allow noninvasive beat-to-beat arterial pressure measurements. 

Numerous studies have investigated the concordance between CNAP measurement and IAP measurement across a variety of clinical populations. Critical appraisal of the quality of these studies followed by synthesis of results in a meta-analysis would aid clinical decision-making regarding the appropriateness of substituting CNAP for IAP devices in clinical practice.  

### Objectives

The objective of this systematic review is to summarise the evidence regarding the concordance between CNAP monitoring and invasive arterial pressure monitoring in order to:

- Examine the extent to which CNAP monitoring and invasive arterial pressure differ;
- Determine the ability of CNAP monitors to track changes in arterial pressure over time (i.e. trending ability); and
<!---I don't think we'll need to do this - remove if you agree: Determine whether measurements from CNAP monitoring can be used to classify people into categories that are clinically meaningful --->

## Methods

A systematic review adhering to the protocol outlined below will be conducted. Differences between this protocol and the review will be reported.
